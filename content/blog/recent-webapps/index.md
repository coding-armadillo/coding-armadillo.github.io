I have created two Django apps to help with kids around the block.

1. [Learn Music](https://learn-music.herokuapp.com)

   This is a collection of assignments for a local music school. It puts the instructions and recordings in one place so that the kids can easily practice even on a tablet or a phone.

2. [Good Neighbor Halloween](https://good-neighbor-halloween.herokuapp.com)

   This is a fun exercise to help planning an optimal route for trick-or-treat within a group of participating households.

Happy hacking!
